Python Projects by Daniel Sol√≥rzano

Welcome to my collection of Python practice projects! I'm currently studying Computer Science and have over 15 years of experience in technical and multilingual support roles. My background in cloud platforms, customer service, and infrastructure has helped shape these projects as I sharpen my programming skills and explore automation, problem-solving, and clean coding practices.
